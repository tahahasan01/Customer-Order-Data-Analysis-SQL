--Importance: Helps in tracking recent activity and monitoring customer engagement for support or marketing purposes. Challenge: Fetching both order and item details for the most recent 5 orders, while ensuring all related data is retrieved. Solution: Used JOIN to combine order, customer, and order items details, sorted by order date in descending order, and limited the results to 5.

--Query 12: List Customers Who Have Purchased Products from at Least Two Different Sellers
--Importance: This query helps in identifying customers who explore products from various sellers, indicating a broader interest in the marketplace. Challenge: Ensuring that a customer has ordered from more than one seller. Solution: The query groups by CustomerID and counts distinct sellers using DISTINCT.


--Query 13: Find Customers Who Have Placed an Order in the Last 30 Days
--Importance: Identifying recent customers allows businesses to target them for feedback, marketing, or promotions. Challenge: Calculating the date range dynamically to find customers who placed orders within the past 30 days. Solution: Used the DATEDIFF function to compare the order date with the current date.

--Query 14: List Customers Who Have Made a Purchase in Every Product Category
--Importance: Identifying loyal or diverse customers who purchase from all product categories is valuable for customer segmentation. Challenge: Ensuring the customer has purchased from every distinct product category. Solution: The query counts distinct categories purchased by a customer and compares it to the total number of product categories.

--Query 15: Calculate the Total Number of Products Sold by Each Seller
--Importance: This query helps sellers evaluate their sales performance and assists businesses in determining which sellers are performing best. Challenge: Aggregating product quantities sold by each seller. Solution: A JOIN between Products and OrderItems is used to calculate total product quantities sold.

--Importance: Identifying top-performing products in recent months aids in marketing and inventory decisions. Challenge: Ensuring the date range is set to the last 30 days, and retrieving the top-selling products. Solution: Used SUM for product sales and limited the result to the top 5.

--Query 17: Retrieve the Latest 5 Orders Along with Customer Details and Order Items for Each Order
--Importance: This query helps businesses track the most recent orders and monitor customer behavior. Challenge: Retrieving complete details, including customers, order items, and products, for the latest orders. Solution: Joined Customers, Orders, and OrderItems tables and filtered the result for the 5 most recent orders.

--Query 18: Retrieve Customers Who Have Made Purchases in Every Product Category, Along with the Total Number of Categories They Have Purchased From
--Importance: Shows loyal customers who buy across all categories, useful for targeted marketing. Challenge: Combining both total categories purchased and ensuring the customer has purchased from all available categories. Solution: Used GROUP BY and HAVING to ensure customers bought from every category.
